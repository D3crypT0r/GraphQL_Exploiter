**Query: Find the names of all students majoring in Computer Science.**

**In TRC, the query can be written as:**
{ S.Name | S ∈ Student AND S.Major = 'Computer Science' }


**Query: Find the names and departments of employees who earn more than $50,000.**
{ E.Name, E.Department | E ∈ Employee AND E.Salary > 50000 }

**Find the names of employees who work in the 'IT' department.**
{ E.Name | E ∈ Employee AND E.Department = 'IT' }

**To find the names of all students majoring in Computer Science who are either older than 20 or have a GPA greater than 3.5.**
{ S.Name | S ∈ Student AND S.Major = 'Computer Science' AND (S.Age > 20 OR S.GPA > 3.5) }
{ S.Name | ... }

Specifies that the result will be a set of Name attributes from the tuples that satisfy the given condition.
S ∈ Student

S is a tuple variable that ranges over the Student relation. It means that S represents a tuple from the Student table.
S.Major = 'Computer Science'

This is one condition that must be satisfied for the tuples to be included in the result set. It states that the Major attribute of the tuple S must be 'Computer Science'.
(S.Age > 20 OR S.GPA > 3.5)

This is another condition using logical connectives. It states that either the Age attribute must be greater than 20 or the GPA attribute must be greater than 3.5.
Combining the Conditions
Tuple Variable: S is a variable that stands for tuples from the Student relation.
Conditions:
The major should be 'Computer Science' (S.Major = 'Computer Science').
Either the age should be greater than 20 (S.Age > 20) or the GPA should be greater than 3.5 (S.GPA > 3.5).
Projection: The query projects the Name attribute from each tuple S that satisfies both conditions.
